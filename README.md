A parser and interpreter of a small subset of Python language, written in haxe.

This haxe lib is still under construction.

The next massive updates will be around June 2016, when I am away from school.


I am even not sure that whether this project will be abandoned.

So **use with caution!!**

**Also, everyone is welcome to contribute!!**
